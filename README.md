# Glowing Eyes
A minecraft mod to make your eyes glow! Inspired by the mod "Vampirism"

I was once playing skyblock with my friend and I suddenly had the urge to install vampirism and get myself a pair of glowing eyes, but the modpack wasn't made for vampirism, so I decided to create a seperate mod adding exclusively the glowing eyes!

## Usage
You can toggle your glowing eyes by doing typing `/eyes toggle on` in chat and you can toggle them off by typing `/eyes toggle off`

To change the type of your eyes, type `/eyes type <number>` where `<number>` can be any number from 0 to 15. The eyes are currently all the same as in the vampirism mod, but I might add some kind of customization later

## Known Issues
No currently known issues.


**The eye textures and some code has been taken from the [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism) mod, make sure to check it out!**
