# Glowing Eyes
A minecraft mod to make your eyes glow, inspired by the mod [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism)<br>
I was once playing SkyBlock with my friend and I suddenly had the urge to install [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism) and get myself a pair of glowing eyes, but the modpack wasn't made for [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism), so I decided to create a separate mod adding exclusively the glowing eyes!

## How to download
Currently, you there are no publicly hosted jar files of the mod, so you have to build it yourself.<br>
I will upload the mod to CurseForge as soon as possible and update this section accordingly

## Usage
You can toggle your glowing eyes on by doing typing `/eyes toggle on` in chat, and you can toggle them off by typing `/eyes toggle off`<br>
To change the type of your eyes, type `/eyes type <number>` where `<number>` can be any number from 0 to 16. I have taken textures 0 to 15 from the [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism) mod, 16 I have made myself, but I might add some kind of customization later

## Planned features
- An eye selection GUI, possibly even an editor of some kind

Suggest your ideas in the issues section!

## Known Issues
- It seems ReplayMod doesn't record the glowing eyes, but I don't see it as crucial for now. In case more people want this feature, I'll try to fix it

## Thanks!
Thanks to the [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism) mod and its authors,
contributors for the idea, inspiration, some code and the eye textures! **Please check them out!**<br>
A lot of thanks also go to the [Modded Minecraft Discord Server](discord.gg/moddedmc) for helping me with the code!
